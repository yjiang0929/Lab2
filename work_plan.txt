Before the midpoint check-in, we want to divide the project into three major parts:

Nick Integrate everything into the FPGA and create the two test benches. 3.5 hours
Noah: Noah will implement the shift register. Estimated time: 3 hours
Yichen: Yichen will work on implementing the input conditioner. Estimated time: 2 hours.

We will meet together on Wednesday to test our devices and finish whatâ€™s necessary for the midpoint check-in. This meeting is estimated to take 2-3 hours. 

After the midpoint check-in, we will finish the draft of the finite state machine and have professor review it before we implement. This meeting will probably take 1 hour, and we hope to accomplish it on Wednesday before the midpoint check-in. 

After this, we will begin implementing the final SPI Memory testing. Because a recommended diagram has already been give, we estimate that the implementation and hardware synthesis of this will take 4 hours. We will finish this part as a team. We will spend another hour to finish the report after all the designs have been validated.
